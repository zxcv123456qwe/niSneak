# Data  

The files named health_bin_project****.csv are files that contain the original data after it's been processed and binarized to be used by the niSNEAK algorithm. 
The original datasets can be found under:

``../baselines/hyperopt/data_use`` or ``../baselines/optuna/data_use``


The data files present within here are a representation of that data after going through our binning process, as such each 16 columns of 1s and 0s represent one numerical column from the datasets found in the above mentioned locations
